# dominos-hue
A nodejs IoT project I wrote to communicate with the Dominos UK Order API to monitor the preparation and delivery of an order and using Philips Hue lighting to display progress.

Due to changes made in 2016 to the Dominos UK API, this no longer works with the online API, however the local test data still works and I assume would take little effort to modify to work with the new API.
